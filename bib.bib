abstract="The Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver Z3 can generate proofs of unsatisfiability. We present independent reconstruction of these proofs in the theorem provers Isabelle/HOL and HOL4 with particular focus on efficiency. Our highly optimized implementations outperform previous LCF-style proof checkers for SMT, often by orders of magnitude. Detailed performance data shows that LCF-style proof reconstruction can be faster than proof search in Z3.",

	abstract="Sledgehammer is a component of Isabelle/HOL that employs first-order automatic theorem provers (ATPs) to discharge goals arising in interactive proofs. It heuristically selects relevant facts and, if an ATP is successful, produces a snippet that replays the proof in Isabelle. We extended Sledgehammer to invoke satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers as well, exploiting its relevance filter and parallel architecture. Isabelle users are now pleasantly surprised by SMT proofs for problems beyond the ATPs' reach. Remarkably, the best SMT solver performs better than the best ATP on most of our benchmarks.",
